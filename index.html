    <h1>The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing</h1>
    <h2>Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans</h2>
    <h3>Whoever is happy will make others happy too</h3>
    <p>Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else</p>
    <p>Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant</p>
    <p>Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail</p>
